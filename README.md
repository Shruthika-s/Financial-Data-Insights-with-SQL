# Financial Data Insights: SQL Project for Financial Data Analysis

**Financial Data Insights** is a SQL-based project designed to clean, analyze, and deduplicate financial data. Using the **Company Financials dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaarya25/financials/data), this project provides an excellent opportunity to explore SQL techniques while working with rich financial information, including sales, costs, discounts, and profits across various products and regions.
